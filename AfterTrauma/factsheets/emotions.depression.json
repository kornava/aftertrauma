    { "type": "text", "media": "Depression is a low mood that lasts for a long time, and affects your everyday life. It is not uncommon for people who have experienced a major trauma to experience an episode of depression.  It is particularly important to recognise the symptoms and to share your feelings with people you trust.<br/>If you are given a diagnosis of depression, you might be told that you have mild, moderate or severe depression. This describes what sort of impact your symptoms are having on you currently, and what sort of treatment you're likely to be offered. You might move between different mild, moderate and severe depression during one episode of depression or across different episodes. Treatments can include professional counselling and medication.<br/>There are many things you can do that can help fight depression ranging from eating the right foods, keeping as active as possible, getting the right amount of sleep, treating yourself and having things to look forward to to name a few. More ideas can be found on the Mind website." },
