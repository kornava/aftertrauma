    { "type": "text", "media": "Some therapies available for processing the impact of a traumatic event include:<br/><br/><b>Somatic experiencing.</b><br/>This focuses on bodily sensations, rather than thoughts and memories about the traumatic event. By concentrating on what’s happening in your body, you can release pent-up trauma-related energy through shaking, crying, and other forms of physical release.<br/><br/><b>Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing.</b><br/>This incorporates elements of cognitive-behavioral therapy with eye movements or other forms of rhythmic, left-right stimulation that can “unfreeze” traumatic memories.<br/><br/><b>Cognitive-behavioral therapy.</b><br/>This involves talking to a professional who helps you process and evaluate your thoughts and feelings about a trauma. It includes reframing problems and learning positive self-talk.<br/>No two injured people are the same and will benefit from different therapies. Grace talks about how CBT helped her in her recovery journey." }
