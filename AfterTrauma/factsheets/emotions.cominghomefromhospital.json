    { "type": "text", "media": "Many patients and carers have told us how challenging it is to go home.<br/>Once home, both patient and the family members could face challenging emotions. Patients are relieved to be home but may equally feel frustrated with their slow progress and angry for what happened to them.  Family members could experience similar emotions which will make communication and support difficult.<br/>After a period of time you may become withdrawn, sad or low in mood.<br/>Many people do not like to talk about feeling down or depressed but it is important to acknowledge these feeling and to talk to someone.<br/>You may feel down as you are simply overwhelmed with the amount of things you have to deal with, not having any idea where to start.  You may feel low because you worry about your job, finance or your children.<br/>All of these feelings are to be expected.  It often helps to write them down and talk to someone about it who can help you find solutions or can just listen to you.<br/>Some people describe these feelings in terms of a Grieving Cycle.  Grieving in this sense doesnâ€™t necessarily mean the loss of a loved one, but includes the loss of a former sense of self, abilities, relationships. You may grieve for a variety of different reasons including the loss of your previous 'normal life'.  The cycle includes Shock, Denial, Anger, Depression, Negotiation, and Acceptance (see diagram below).<br/>However, most people after major trauma return to a life just as meaningful, although often different, from how things were before their injuries." },
