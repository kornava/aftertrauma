        media: "After an unexpected event it is quite common to experience a whole host of different emotions.  There is no right and wrong way to feel.  Both family member and patients can experience these emotional roller coasters.  It is quite common for family members to go through this in the first instance while their loved one is in hospital.  This is often due to the lack of communication in the hospital and living with uncertainty while patients in hospital are desperately trying to get better.  The hospital is an unfamiliar environment for many people and dealing with the daily commute to come and see your loved one, working, and sorting out the rest of the family can be quite challenging.  Feelings of worry and helplessness are also quite common.  However, we all respond to these events differently.  Some people will refer to these feelings  as stress and others will call it worry.  Regardless of the words, these are very common emotions to go through.  In the subsequent section we provide more information on stress and worry and tips for dealing with this for both carers and patients."
