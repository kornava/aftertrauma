By concentrating on what’s happening in your body, you can release pent-up trauma-related energy through shaking, crying, and other forms of physical release.</li><li>Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing. This incorporates elements of cognitive-behavioral therapy with eye movements or other forms of rhythmic, left-right stimulation that can “unfreeze” traumatic memories.</li><li>Cognitive-behavioral therapy.  This involves talking to a professional who helps you process and evaluate your thoughts and feelings about a trauma.</li></ul>"
