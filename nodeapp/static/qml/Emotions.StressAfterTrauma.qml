Trauma can result from an accident, an injury, an attack or surgery leaving some individuals experiencing emotional stress. or a more extreme form of this stress is called Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), where symptoms are varied. Stress can become a constant presence in your life. Often after trauma we are so focussed on our recovery. If we are in hospital we may not think about the difficulties we might face once we leave, but for many this can be where the stress begins to build, and this can be true no matter the severity or type of injuries you sustained.

We all react differently to traumatic incidents. Symptoms typically last from a few days to a few months, gradually fading as you process the events. But even when you’re feeling better, you may be troubled from time to time by painful memories or emotions—especially in response to triggers such as an anniversary of the event or something that reminds you of the trauma."
